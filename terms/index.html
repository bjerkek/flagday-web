    <h3>2. Use License</h3>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of (name-not-ready) per device for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

          <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
          <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in (name-not-ready);</li>

          <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Bjerkek AS at any time.

    </ol>
